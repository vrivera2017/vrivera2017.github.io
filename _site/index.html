        <div class="blurb">
          <p>My name is Veronica Rivera and I am a second year PhD student in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am a member of the Assistive Sociotechnical Solutions for Individuals with Special Needs Using Technology (ASSIST) lab and am advised by Professor Sri Kurniawan.</p> <p>My research is in <b>Human-Computer Interaction, Assistive Technology, and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.</b> I am primarily focused on creating interactive personalized technology to help students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) better learn and work collaboratively with their peers in the classroom. My research goals are two-fold. 1) I seek to better understand how students with ASD use technology and social media through interviews, observations and surveys. And 2) leverage those findings to develop engaging educational applications that help each student learn and improve. I aim to create applications that can adapt to each student's needs, so that all students with ASD using the application can recieve the maximum support and learning benefits, despite individual differences in their cognitive abilities</p> <p> In May 2017 I obtained a B.S in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics with a Concentration in Psychology at Harvey Mudd College, where I obtained a 4 year full-tuition President's Scholarship. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in knot theory and computer vision.</p>
