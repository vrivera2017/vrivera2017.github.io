      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am an Embedded Ethics Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, jointly appointed in the Computer Science Department, the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/">Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)</a> and the <a href="https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/">McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society</a>.</p>
<p>I conduct mixed-methods user research and critically analyze digital systems to understand and mitigate technology-facilitated harms, especially those that span multiple platforms or reach into the physical world. I leverage the results of my work to develop generalizable frameworks for technical and policy protections. Through this approach, I have systematized on/offline harms across various user groups and platforms, identified people&rsquo;s protective strategies, and designed interventions to enhance digital safety. Much of my work has focused on better supporting people from marginalized and/or vulnerable communities, including women and platform-based gig workers.</p>
<p>At Stanford I work with <a href="https://zakird.com/">Zakir Durumeric</a> in the <a href="https://esrg.stanford.edu/">Empirical Security Research Group</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://elissaredmiles.com/">Elissa Redmiles</a> (Georgetown University).</p>
<p>I completed my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I was advised by David Lee. During my PhD I also worked closely with Elissa Redmiles as a visiting student at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. Prior to my PhD, I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College where I was supported by a 4 year President&rsquo;s Scholarship. My time at Harvey Mudd contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.</p>
<p><strong>I am on the academic job market (2024-25) seeking tenure-track positions in Computer Science, Information Science, and related areas.</strong></p>
