<p>I am a 4th year <a href="https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/computational-media">Computational Media</a> PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I study Human-Computer Interaction and Social Computing. I am a member of the <a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/">Tech4Good Lab</a> and am advised by David Lee.</p>
<p>My research focuses on <strong>understanding and supporting digitally mediated work and learning environments</strong>. I am interested in exploring the role of digital technologies in online work and learning, how to enable digital platforms and tools to better support users&rsquo; educational and career goals, and issues of security, equity, and fairness in digital work. My research incorporates qualitative methods, user studies, and human-subject experiments. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Prior to beginning my PhD I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> where I was supported by a 4 year <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/admission/afford/scholarships-and-grants/merit-based-scholarships/presidents-scholars-program/">President's Scholarship</a>. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in Knot Theory with <a href="https://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/VNelson/">Sam Nelson</a> and in Computer Vision/Robotics with <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/">Zachary Dodds</a>. My undergraduate research experiences contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.</p>
