      <description>Additional Projects College Scorecard Data Explorer Application in use. Displaying admissions rate vs. in-state tuition for institutions in CA, FL, NV, and VT. Motivation: Recently I found that the U.S Department of Education maintains a dataset called the College Scorecard Dataset, which contains aggregate information for various institutions of higher education in the U.S such as costs and admissions statistics. This information could be incredibly useful for students and families, yet it is difficult to parse through and the amount of information is overwhelming.</description>

      <description>Research Project Summaries Career Development and Online Crowdwork This is an ongoing project in which I seek to understand the career goals of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and how the online on-demand labor platform contributes to unique challenges in developing workers&amp;rsquo; careers overtime. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in understanding how these challenges may create difficulties for workers who want to transition careers into specialized online freelance work or white-collar jobs in more traditional brick-and-mortar organizations.</description>

      <description>Teaching Stanford Most of my teaching at Stanford was done in the context of the Embedded Ethics program. I led teams of CS faculty and teaching assistants to create and teach ethics curriculum in CS courses. Some of our materials are open source on the Embedded Ethics website. Please reach out to me if you are interested in seeing additional material for the courses I led below.
Ethics Curriculum 2023, 2024 (x2), 2025 CS 221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques Large intro-level AI course.</description>
