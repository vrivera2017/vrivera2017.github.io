<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
<p>I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant over three quarters for the following two courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPS 12A Introduction to Programming, Accelerated (Fall 2018)</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPS 5J Introduction to Programming in Java (Winter 2018, Spring 2018)</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPM 178 Human-Centered Design Research (Winter 2021)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these courses I was involved in leading multiple lab sections each week and holding weekly office hours. I helped students with lab and homework assignments, and helped them prepare for quizzes and exams. I was also responsible for grading assignments and exams, and overseeing undergraduate course tutors. For CMPM 178 specifically, I provide written feedback for students on in-class presentations and help support them in carrying out a quarter-long human-centered design project.</p>
<h3 id="undergraduate-research-mentoring">Undergraduate Research Mentoring</h3>
<p>As part of the Tech4Good Lab I am involved in leading multiple teams of undergraduate research students each quarter. These teams work on tasks that contribute to the research projects I am working on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Winter 2020:</strong> This quarter I am leading three teams&ndash;an analytics team, a UX research team, and a qualitative analysis team. For the analytics team, I am continuing to work with the members of the Fall 2019 team, and an additional student, on logging data from user interaction using Angular, testing and revising the python functions for graph generation, and writing code to automatically generate the reports for remote usability tests. For the UX research team, I am leading two undergraduate students in conducting usability studies (think-aloud) of Causeway, an online web application for learning web development. I am also leading these students in interviewing participants of our usability tests to understand how they learn on the platform. For the qualitative analysis team I will be teaching students from the UX research team and another lab team how to conduct qualitative analysis for the qualitative data they gather for their specific tasks in the lab. I will also be working with my advisor, David Lee, to further develop the qualitative analysis training process I began in Fall 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fall 2019:</strong> I led two teams this quarter&ndash;an analytics team and a qualitative analysis team. For the analytics team I led three undergraduate students in creating templates of data reports that will be generated in future remote usability studies of Causeway. I helped the students think through the core research questions for the project, and guided them in deciding what data needs to be logged from user interaction with the app, as well as what kinds of graphs and visualizations would be most appropriate to include in the reports. I also led the team in writing python functions to create graphs and visualizations for the reports. For the qualitative analysis team I led two undergraduate studeents in conducting thematic analysis of surveys and interviews with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. Both of the undergraduate studnets I mentored had no prior experience conducting qualitative analysis, so I taught them about coding, writing analytic memos, and began developing a process for training undergraduate students in qualitative analysis for use by future lab teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spring 2019:</strong> I led two undergraduate students in conducting interviews of individuals who transitioned into engineering and development careers from non-technical careers. Both of the undergraduate students I mentored had no prior experience conducting qualitative research, so I was responsible for teaching them how to write strong interview questions, recruit participants, conduct semi-structured interviews, and write point of view and how might we statements to generate research ideas and directions.</p>
