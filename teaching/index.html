<p>Most of my teaching at Stanford was done in the context of the Embedded Ethics program. I led teams of CS faculty and teaching assistants to create and teach ethics curriculum in CS courses. Some of our materials are open source on the <a href="https://embeddedethics.stanford.edu/">Embedded Ethics website</a>. Please reach out to me if you are interested in seeing additional material for the courses I led below.</p>
