<p>I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UC Santa Cruz for the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CSE 20 Beginning Programming in Python (Spring 2021)</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPM 178 Human-Centered Design Research (Winter 2021)</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPS 12A Introduction to Programming, Accelerated (Fall 2018)</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz CMPS 5J Introduction to Programming in Java (Winter 2018, Spring 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these courses I was involved in leading multiple lab sections each week and holding weekly office hours. I helped students with lab and homework assignments, and helped them prepare for quizzes and exams. I was also responsible for grading assignments and exams, and overseeing undergraduate course tutors. For CMPM 178 specifically, I provide written feedback for students on in-class presentations and help support them in carrying out a quarter-long human-centered design project.</p>
