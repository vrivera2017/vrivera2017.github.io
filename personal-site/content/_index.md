## About Me

I am a 5th year [Computational Media][compmedia] PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I study Human-Computer Interaction and Social Computing. I am a member of the [Tech4Good Lab][t4good] and am advised by David Lee. I also work with [Elissa Redmiles][Elissa] in the Safety and Society group at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems.

My research focuses on **supporting worker safety and well-being in the platform-based gig economy**. I am broadly interested in topics related to digitally-mediated labor, safety, security, and trust. I leverage qualitative and survey findings to think about how we might design systems and platforms that are more inclusive, safe, and worker-centered. 

Prior to beginning my PhD I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College][hmc] where I was supported by a 4 year [President's Scholarship][psp]. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in Knot Theory with [Sam Nelson][nelson] and in Computer Vision/Robotics with [Zachary Dodds][dodds]. My undergraduate research experiences contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.

## Research Projects
{{< project-icons image = "/images/trust.jpg">}}
#### Bias, Harassments, and Safety in Gig Work 
What are the perceptions and experiences of bias and harassment for vulnerable gig workers? How do gig workers define safety, what factors threaten those definitions, and what actions do they take to mitigate perceived safety risks? How do these findings translate to design and policy implications for the HCI and security communities?

#### Career Development on Amazon Mechanical Turk 
What are the career goals of crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk? What challenges do they face in pursuing their career goals? How do environmental factors within crowdwork platforms support or inhibit their pursuit of career goals?
