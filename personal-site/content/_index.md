## About Me

I am an Embedded Ethics Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, jointly appointed in the Computer Science Department, the [Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)][hai] and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society][ethics-center]. 

My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Security and Privacy. I conduct mixed-methods user research and critically analyze digital systems to understand and mitigate technology-facilitated harms, especially those that span multiple platforms or reach into the physical world. I leverage the results of my work to develop generalizable frameworks for technical and policy protections. Through this approach, I have systematized on/offline harms across various user groups and platforms, identified people's protective strategies, and designed interventions to enhance digital safety. Much of my work has focused on better supporting people from marginalized and/or vulnerable communities, including women and platform-based gig workers. 

At Stanford I work with [Zakir Durumeric][Zakir] in the [Empirical Security Research Group][esrg]. I also work closely with [Elissa Redmiles][Elissa] (Georgetown University). 

I completed my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I was advised by David Lee. During my PhD I also worked closely with Elissa Redmiles as a visiting student at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. Prior to my PhD, I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College where I was supported by a 4 year President's Scholarship. My time at Harvey Mudd contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning. 

**I am on the academic job market (2024-25) seeking tenure-track positions in Computer Science, Information Science, and related areas.**
