## About Me

I am a 5th year [Computational Media][compmedia] PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I study Human-Computer Interaction and Social Computing. I am a member of the [Tech4Good Lab][t4good] and am advised by David Lee. 

My research focuses on **supporting worker well-being in the platform-based gig economy**. Lately I have been focusing on understanding gig workers' career goals, and the experiences of gig workers from marginalized groups. In my work I leverage qualitative findings to think about how we might design systems and platforms that are more inclusive and worker-centered. <!--I am also broadly interested in issues of fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics and privacy arising from using socio-technical systems for work and learning.-->

Prior to beginning my PhD I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College][hmc] where I was supported by a 4 year [President's Scholarship][psp]. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in Knot Theory with [Sam Nelson][nelson] and in Computer Vision/Robotics with [Zachary Dodds][dodds]. My undergraduate research experiences contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.

#### Designing Systems for Apprenticeship Learning at Scale 
How might we design online learning environments that support apprenticeship learning at scale? How should we design instructional support and materials within these platforms to enable learning without the need for individual mentors?
