## About Me

I am a 3rd year [Computational Media][compmedia] PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I study Human-Computer Interaction and Social Computing. I am a member of the [Tech4Good Lab][t4good] and am advised by David Lee. I am currently supported by the UC Santa Cruz Chancellor's Graduate Internship Program. 

My research focuses on the future of work and education, specifically on **how to support learning and career development in online work and learning environments**. I am interested in exploring how to leverage socio-technical systems to bridge work and learning, support online on-demand workers in their educational pursuits, and scale apprenticeship learning and mentorship opportunities. I use a combination of qualitative methods, user studies, and human-subject experiments to study, design, and build sociotechnical systems that support work and learning. <!--I am also broadly interested in issues of fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics and privacy arising from using socio-technical systems for work and learning.-->

Prior to beginning my PhD I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College][hmc] where I was supported by a 4 year [President's Scholarship][psp]. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in Knot Theory with [Sam Nelson][nelson] and in Computer Vision/Robotics with [Zachary Dodds][dodds]. My undergraduate research experiences contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.
