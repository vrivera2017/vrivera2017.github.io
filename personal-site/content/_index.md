## About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, working with [Yixin Zou][yixin]. 

In Fall 2026, I will start as an assistant professor at Georgia Tech in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. 

I use empirical approaches from computer security and human-computer interaction to understand and mitigate the digital safety risks of sociotechnical systems, including hate, harassment, physical abuse, and financal harm. I am interested in how to protect users' digital safety when harm can be experienced across multiple platforms and physical spaces. Some research directions I am currently interested in (though definitely not an exhaustive list): 

* **Digital abuse reporting:** Understanding what it means to safely use technology to report on and offline abuse; Developing abuse reporting systems that ensure different definitions of safety (e.g., privacy). 
* **Safer uses of AI:** Identifying the technical and social limitations of AI for creating a safer internet ecosystem; Developing AI tools for high risk offline contexts, such as labor and health. 
* **Measuring digital safety:** Developing the tools and methodology to measure digital safety risk. 

<!--I use socio-scientific techniques to study the digital safety risks of sociotechnical systems and design mitigations against these abuses. -->

<!--My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Security and Privacy. I conduct mixed-methods empirical research and critically analyze digital systems to understand and mitigate technology-facilitated harms, especially those that span multiple platforms or reach into the physical world. I leverage the results of my work to develop generalizable frameworks for technical and policy protections. Through this approach, I have systematized on/offline harms across various user groups and platforms, identified people's protective strategies, and designed interventions to enhance digital safety. Much of my work has focused on better supporting people from marginalized and/or vulnerable communities, including women and platform-based gig workers. --> 

Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University in the computer science department, where I worked with [Zakir Durumeric][Zakir]. I also worked with the Embedded Ethics Program, joint across the [Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)][hai] and the [McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society][ethics-center], where I taught ethics in computer science classes. I completed my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, advised by [David Lee][david]. During my PhD I was also advised by [Elissa Redmiles][Elissa] as a visiting student at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. I earned a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College where I was supported by a 4 year President's Scholarship. My time at Harvey Mudd contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and teaching.
