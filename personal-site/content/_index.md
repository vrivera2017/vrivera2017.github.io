## About Me

I am a [Computational Media][compmedia] PhD candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz where I study Human-Computer Interaction and am advised by David Lee. I also work closely with Elissa Redmiles at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, where I am currently a visiting researcher in the Safety and Society group.

My research focuses on **harm in digitally-mediated offline interactions**. In my dissertation research I have investigated such harms in the context of gig work. I am broadly interested in topics related to safety, security, digital harm and/or future of work. I leverage qualitative and survey findings to think about how we might design systems and policy that make our interactions with technology safer. I am also passionate about teaching; At UCSC I designed and taught the first ethics class for the HCI Master's program. 

Prior to beginning my PhD I received a B.S degree in Joint Computer Science and Mathematics from [Harvey Mudd College][hmc] where I was supported by a 4 year [President's Scholarship][psp]. During my time at Harvey Mudd College I conducted research in Knot Theory with [Sam Nelson][nelson] and in Computer Vision/Robotics with [Zachary Dodds][dodds]. My undergraduate research experiences contributed greatly to my passion for scholarship and learning.
