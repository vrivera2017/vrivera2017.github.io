## Stanford ##
Most of my teaching at Stanford was done in the context of the Embedded Ethics program. I led teams of CS faculty and teaching assistants to create and teach ethics curriculum in CS courses. Some of our materials are open source on the [Embedded Ethics website][ethics-site]. Please reach out to me if you are interested in seeing additional material for the courses I led below. 

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2023, 2024 (x2), 2025" class = "CS 221: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques">}}
Large intro-level AI course. Myself and various teaching assistants wrote 1-2 homework problems across 8 assignments that connects various ethics topics to the technical material of the course. We also created and filmed 10-15 minute ethics lectures that support these homework problems. Example topics include: dual use, safe exploration in reinforcement learning, reward hacking, and explainability.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2023" class = "CS 177: Human-Centered Product Management">}}
Product management course focusing on design, organizational, and interpersonal skills. Myself and various teaching assistants created a lecture and class activity to help students understand how ethics and values are built into products.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2024, 2025" class = "CS 124: From Language to Information">}}
Intro-level NLP course. Myself and various teaching assistants created three ethics units on sentiment classification, information retrieval, and large language models that were taught as in-class labs in a flipped classroom.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2023, 2024 (x2), 2025" class = "CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems">}}
Intro-level computer systems. I facilitated homework assignments that bridge technical content of the course to topics in security and privacy including trust, partiality, and responsible disclosure.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2024 (x2), 2025" class = "CS 106B: Programming Abstractions">}}
Second course in the Stanford CS sequence, focus on object-oriented programming, data structures, and run-time. I created and taught a new lecture that encourages early-career CS students to think about how they can practice ethics beyond code-level or UI-level changes to products.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2024 (x2)" class = "CS 106A: Programming Methodology">}}
Large intro CS class for students with no prior programming background. I revised and taught lectures on end-to-end encryption and data ethics to support homework problems on these topics.

{{< teaching role = "Ethics Curriculum" year = "2025" class = "CS 278: Social Computing">}}
Design patterns for social computing systems. Myself and a teaching assistant wrote a reflection assignment to guide students in thinking about the ethical implications of their final projects.

{{< teaching role = "Course Designer & Instructor" year = "2023" class = "Ethics in Tech">}}
2 week high school course on ethics in technology. Based on my UCSC HCI 220 graduate-level course.

{{< teaching role = "Course Designer & Instructor" year = "2022, 2023" class = "HCI 220: Ethics and Activism in Tech and Design" site = "https://sites.google.com/view/hci220w23/">}}
Graduate-level course surveying topics related to tech ethics (e.g. race and gender issues, privacy, AI bias) and tech activism (e.g. labor movements). Course topics discussed through a design lens. Made a required course by the program director after the first offering in 2022.
