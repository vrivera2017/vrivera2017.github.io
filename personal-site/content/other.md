**Motivation:** Colors are often used to visually represent emotions. There have been numerous studies conducted in Human-Computer Interaction and Psychology to determine which colors people most often associate with specific emotions and how color can be used to evoke certain emotions as well. Beyond this, color is also a very powerful tool for data visualization, as it allows information to be represented in a concise and easy to understand format. One group of people that benefits from visual information is children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Many children with ASD struggle to read facial expressions of emotion. This inspired the creation of ColorMe, a prototype tool that might be used to help children with ASD learn to read facial expressions of emotion. 

**Description:** ColorMe is an application designed for the web that uses Affectivaâ€™s emotion detection software to detect four emotions from users' facial expressions using a webcam. Each emotion is represented visually using a color overlaid on top of the video feed and the corresponding emoji adjacent to the video feed display. The emotions supported by the prototype application are happy, sad, angry and neutral/no emotion. Code for the application is available in this [GitHub repository][colorme]. 

**Results:** This prototype was completed as my final project for CMPS 261 (now CSE 261) Advanced Visualization at UC Santa Cruz in Spring 2018.

**Technologies used:** Affectiva, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
