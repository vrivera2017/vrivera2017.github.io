<ul>
<li>
<p>This is an ongoing project in which I seek to understand the career goals of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and how the online on-demand labor platform contributes to unique challenges in developing workers&rsquo; careers overtime. I'm interested in understanding how these challenges may create difficulties for workers who want to transition careers into specialized online freelance work or white-collar jobs in more traditional brick-and-mortar organizations. To better understand career development more broadly, I began by interviewing 5 individuals who transitioned jobs into a completely new industry&ndash;from nontechnical jobs into various engineering and development roles. Through these interviews I found that close interpersonal relationships were essential to successfully learning new skills and landing a job in a new area. I used these findings to frame surveys with ~120 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and interviews with 6 of those workers. Currently I am working on using thematic analysis to analyze the survey and interview data, and writing a research paper based on these findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> semi-structured interviews, qualitative analysis (thematic analysis)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="doing-by-learning">Doing By Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this project I am working on evaluating two different interfaces for <a href="https://causeway.soe.ucsc.edu/#/">Causeway</a>, a web development learning platform. Both interfaces model doing by learning, the act of novices achieving real-world goals while learning and building their skill set. However, the interfaces differ in the amount of guidance and scaffolding of instructions they provide users. I am interested in 1) evaluating how doing by learning is better for learning and motivation than learning by doing, in which novices are not engaged in accomplishing real-world tasks and projects and 2) determining the optimal way to model doing by learning in online educational platforms. To do this, I am working on conducting usability studies of the two interfaces and am in the early stages of planning large-scale learning experiments to evaluate users&rsquo; learning gains and motivation around web development and computer science education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> usability testing, semi-structured interviews, data logging, data analytics</p>
